# Contributing

Right now, I am in the middle of development of this system inside a PDP-11 virtual machine. As such, this git is not always up to date -- so I am not taking contributions for code at this time. Suggestions for features may be submitted thru the GitHub issues, and I will accept contributions for documentation if any are offered.
